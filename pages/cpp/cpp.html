                            This C++ project uses the FUSE library in linux, and my own custom library, to treat
                            DOOM WAD(Wheres All the Data?) files as their own file directories.
                            This way, you can send a WAD file to anyone, and they can mount it, and perform read,
                            write, copy, and other file operations on it.

                            This is a C++ program that parses crime data from los angeles between the years of 2010 to 2017.
                            Its purpose is to compare the efficiencies of certain algorithms over others.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            There are two algorithms that you can use in this program: fibonacci heap and a hash map based on a min-heap

                            Sometimes, the memory allocator given in standard C and C++ isnt suitable.

                            <br>
                            In this case, I opted to write my own memory allocation library that works on the 
                            best fit and worst fit algorithms.

                            I've used photoshop pretty often. Especially the blending techniques present in it.

                            <br>
                            But how are those techniques actually performed? This program seeks to answer that.

                            <br>
                            This is a simple image processor that allows you to perform various image manipulation
                            techniques on TGA files such as subtracting, multipling, overlaying, etc.

                <h1>Linked List</h1>
                        <div class = "text">
                            This was my first introduction to data structures, a linked list!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I was tasked with creating a linear data structure using pointers that allows
                            you to store anything you want inside of it. Whether it be integers, pointers, structs,
                            or strings, I found way to implement it.
                            It uses templates, meaning you can store whatever you want inside of it.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Ever since being taught linked lists, ive used it consistently throughout my career.

                        <div class = "text">
                            I was assigned to research and determine the efficiency
                            of various types of cache implementations.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To do this, I wrote a cache simulator in C++. It simulates
                            fully associative, set associative, and direct mapped cache.

                            In addition, I compiled all my results in a paper in the repository. Give it a read!
